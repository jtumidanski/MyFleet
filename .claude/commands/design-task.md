description: Phase 2 — invoke superpowers:brainstorming to produce a design doc inside the task worktree
argument-hint: Task identifier — accepts "task-001-bucket-replication", "task-001", "001", or "1"
---

You are starting Phase 2 of the MyFleet four-phase development workflow. Argument: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Process

### Step 1 — Resolve the task

1. **Fuzzy-match the task folder name** by globbing across both the main repo and all sibling worktrees:
   - Main repo: `docs/tasks/task-*`
   - Worktrees: `.worktrees/*/docs/tasks/task-*`

   Match `$ARGUMENTS` against folder names with these patterns (in order):
   - Exact: `task-NNN-slug` matches `task-NNN-slug`
   - Number-only: `1` or `001` or `task-1` or `task-001` matches any folder named `task-001-*`
   - Slug fragment: `bucket-replication` matches `task-NNN-bucket-replication-dashboard`

2. If zero matches: stop and ask the user for a corrected identifier.
3. If multiple matches: list them and ask the user to pick.
4. If the resolved task lives in `docs/tasks/` (main) but NOT in any worktree, that's an error state — the four-phase workflow requires a task worktree. Stop and tell the user:
   > Task `<id>` exists on main but has no worktree. The current workflow expects every task to have its own worktree (created by `/spec-task`). Either move the task into a worktree or run `/spec-task` from scratch.
5. Otherwise, the resolved location is `<worktree>/docs/tasks/<id>/`. Record `<worktree>` as the absolute path you'll use for all subsequent operations.

### Step 2 — Ensure we're in the right worktree

Run `pwd`. If it does NOT match `<worktree>`, `cd <worktree>` yourself and continue from there. Do NOT ask the user to re-run the command — per CLAUDE.md's "Worktree Discipline" rule, cd into the task worktree yourself.

### Step 3 — Validate inputs

1. Confirm `<worktree>/docs/tasks/<id>/prd.md` exists. If not, tell the user to run `/spec-task` first.
2. Confirm `design.md` does NOT already exist. If it does, ask whether to overwrite or open the existing one.

### Step 4 — Load context

Read:
- `<worktree>/docs/tasks/<id>/prd.md`
- `<worktree>/CLAUDE.md`
- Code areas implied by the PRD's Service Impact section

### Step 5 — Invoke brainstorming

Use the Skill tool to invoke `superpowers:brainstorming`. Pass:

- The PRD is at `<worktree>/docs/tasks/<id>/prd.md` and is approved — SKIP the default what/why questions.
- Focus on architecture, alternatives, tradeoffs.
- Output MUST be saved to `<worktree>/docs/tasks/<id>/design.md` (NOT the skill's default location).
- Do NOT auto-invoke `writing-plans`. The user runs `/clear` then `/plan-task <id>` separately.

### Step 6 — Commit and summarize

Once the design is approved, commit it on the task branch:

```
git add docs/tasks/<id>/design.md
git commit -m "design(<id>): architecture and tradeoffs"
```

Verify post-commit:

```
git rev-parse --show-toplevel  # must end with /.worktrees/<id>
git branch --show-current      # must be <id>
```

If either is wrong, STOP and report BLOCKED. Then tell the user:

> Design saved and committed. Now run `/clear`, then `/plan-task <id>`. (You're already in the right worktree.)

## Important Rules

- All file I/O uses absolute paths under `<worktree>`.
- Never write design artifacts under main's `docs/tasks/`.
- DO NOT begin implementation. This phase produces a design document only.

Write the full design.md in one shot. Commit it. Reply only with the file path and commit SHA — do NOT summarize or walk through sections.
