# Slice First; Escalate When Necessary

How to read a large artifact inside an agent or a controller.

**This is a default, not a prohibition.** If semantic correctness requires the
whole document, read the whole document. Under-reading and getting it wrong
costs a fix round, which is far more than any read it saved. The rule is only
that a whole-file read should be a *decision*, not the reflex opening move.

## The measurement (atlas)

Cost is not bytes; it is bytes × the turns that re-read them. A result entering
at turn 5 of a 200-turn agent is re-billed ~195 times; the same result at turn
190 is re-billed 10 times.

That multiplier lands where it hurts most, per atlas's measurement:

> **The median tool result over 12 KB arrives at position 0.10 of its stream,
> and 75% of them arrive in the first quarter.**

So the heavy tail is not merely large — it is placed exactly where it is most
expensive. Measured on one atlas task: 268 results >12 KB carried 26.8% of all
tool bytes from 2.4% of calls, and total carry came to 0.92 GB-turns ≈ 18% of
the task's entire billed input. These figures are atlas measurements, cited
here as evidence for the rule below; re-measuring them against MyFleet is out
of scope for this document.

The two costliest objects in that atlas task were documents, not code:

| Carry | Reads | Streams | Document |
|---|---|---|---|
| 37.5 MB-turns | 26 | 25 | `service-wiring-recipe.md` (23 KB) |
| 31.8 MB-turns | 48 | 16 | `query-scope-audit.md` (126 KB) |
| 21.5 MB-turns | 155 | — | `processor.go` (for comparison) |

Two files, 74 of 11,102 tool calls, **7.5% of all carry**. Read 26 and 48 times,
nearly always whole, when each agent needed one Pattern section or a handful of
service rows.

**The documents are not the problem.** They are the reason 40+ atlas services
were wired consistently, and a thinner recipe would be re-derived by every
agent at far greater cost. Change the access pattern; leave the content
complete.

## The rule

**For any file you expect to exceed ~20 KB, lead with a slice.**

Escalate to a full read when the slice is insufficient — and when you do, say so
in your report, because a document that is repeatedly escalated is a document
that needs restructuring.

`tools/doc-slice.sh` is the accessor:

```sh
# What is in here, and where? Cheap first move on an unfamiliar document.
tools/doc-slice.sh docs/verification.md --outline

# The one section this batch needs.
tools/doc-slice.sh docs/verification.md --section 'unreachable-cluster skip'

# The rows for the services in this brief — table header preserved.
tools/doc-slice.sh docs/roadmap.md --rows fleet-service --rows media-service

# A needle in an offloaded tool result, rather than re-reading it whole.
tools/doc-slice.sh <session>/tool-results/bd3sc8ctl.txt --grep 'PANIC' --context 3
```

It prints the source path and size with every slice, so escalation is always one
deliberate step away.

## Where each case lands

| Situation | Slice-first move | Escalate when |
|---|---|---|
| One plan task out of a large `plan.md` | `tools/task-brief.sh <plan> <N>` — the brief IS the extract | the task references a decision recorded elsewhere in the plan |
| Auditing many plan tasks (`plan-adherence-reviewer`) | one `task-brief.sh` extract per task under audit | never read the whole plan repeatedly — that is a known atlas anti-pattern |
| A reference recipe | `--outline`, then `--section '<pattern named in the brief>'` | the section cross-references another pattern |
| An audit / result matrix | `--rows <service>` for the services in scope | a row's meaning depends on the document's preamble — the invariants preamble travels with every slice for exactly this reason |
| A review diff | `git diff --stat <range>` first, then `git diff <range> -- <file>` per flagged file | a change's correctness genuinely spans files |
| An offloaded `tool-results/*.txt` | `--grep` / `--lines` from disk | you need the whole log, which is rare |
| A config or routing table | `grep -n` for the entries you need | you are changing its structure, not one entry |
| Source code | targeted `grep -n` / `sed -n` for the symbol, then read the file that owns it | reading a file you are about to edit — do read it |

That last row matters: **targeted read slices are not the problem.** In the
atlas measurement they were the single largest Bash family (3,158 calls) and
they are agents choosing what to look at — semantic work, done well. This
document is about whole-document reads as a discovery reflex, not about
reading less.

## Front-load the cheap thing, not the expensive one

If you need both an inventory and a detail, take the inventory first:
`git diff --stat` before hunks, `--outline` before `--section`, `ls` before
`Read`. The inventory is small and tells you which expensive read is actually
required — and it arrives at the position where a large result would have been
worst.

## What already works — do not "improve" it

Build and test output is consistently bounded (`go build ./... 2>&1 | head -60`
and friends): in the atlas measurement, 1,251 invocations produced 0.81 MB
in-context, ~650 bytes each. The tool-result spill mechanism works too — large
payloads land as small stubs and get sliced from disk. Both are the model this
document asks documentation reads to copy, not costs to trim.
